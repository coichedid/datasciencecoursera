# Data Science Specialization

This is my main repository of Data Science Specialization Course @ Coursera, provided by Johns Hopkins University.

As the main repo, all individual projects related to courses of this specialization are folders here or links to other repos.

As first project, of Data Scientist's Toolbox, we have just a few files like tools installations screenshots and some markdown files.
